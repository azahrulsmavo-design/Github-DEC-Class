# Workshop: GitHub Workflow Data Engineering Lite

Welcome to the **GitHub Workflow Workshop**!

This repository serves as the **Starter Template** for the workshop. You will learn how to automate quality checks using GitHub Actions while working on a simple Python Data Engineering pipeline.

## Workshop Materials

Everything you need is in the `workshop_materials/` folder:

1.  **[00_github_setup.md](workshop_materials/00_github_setup.md)**: Preparation guide (Git & GitHub Account).
2.  **[02_instructions.md](workshop_materials/02_instructions.md)**: **MAIN CHeatsheet**. Follow this step-by-step during the workshop!
    *   Task 1: Implement Feature (`feat`)
    *   Task 2: Fix Bug (`fix`)
    *   Task 3: Automated Testing (Bonus)

## Project Structure
*   `src/etl_pipeline.py`: The Python script you will work on.
*   `data/`: Dummy data for the pipeline.
*   `.github/workflows/`: The "Robot" that checks your code.

## How to Start
1.  **Fork** this repository (Top right button).
2.  **Clone** to your local machine.
